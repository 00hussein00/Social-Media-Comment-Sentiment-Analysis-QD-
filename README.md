# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media data using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to classify user posts or tweets as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** to gain insights into public opinion.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal)
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of results (bar charts, word clouds)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk

## ðŸ§  Skills Applied

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Supervised machine learning
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Social Media Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire workflow
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store raw or processed datasets
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

The notebook includes output such as:

- Accuracy scores of the models  
- Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments  
- Confusion matrix and classification report  

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)  
- Expand to multi-language sentiment analysis  
- Integrate with real-time data sources (e.g., Twitter API)
